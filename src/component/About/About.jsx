        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Born and raised in Chicago, with a passion for technology. There isn't a challenge that I am not willing to try and with the ambition I have, there isn't one I wont beat. I'm a full stack software engineer with a perfectionist attitude when it comes to both organization and finding better and more efficient ways to solve complex problems. I have always seen code like an art, since before I learned how it worked, from the flow of functions to the delicate art that is styling, and like any other art I feel like it can always evolve on a constant journey to perfection. Always looking to improve my skill set by tackling any problem, regardless of size. Technology is always evolving, so let's perfect it.</p>
